This is similar to &quot;bounty programs&quot; seen in other open source environments, though it is driven by SciML in a manner that is designed to give better outcomes to both contributors and maintainers of the project. In order to remove a hostile competitive atmosphere, <strong>candidates must declare to the committee interest before solving the chosen issue</strong> and, upon approval by the selection committee, are given an exclusive time interval &#40;defaulting to one month&#41; to solve the issue. Payout is done upon completion of the chosen project and acceptance by the steering council.</p> <p>All projects are expected to contribute the code to repositories in the SciML Github organization. Code which is not contributed to the open source repositories will not be considered in the approval evaluations.</p> <h2 id=declaring_for_a_project ><a href="#declaring_for_a_project" class=header-anchor >Declaring for a Project</a></h2> <p>To declare for a small grant program, open a pull request on the Github repo for <a href="https://github.com/SciML/sciml.ai">https://github.com/SciML/sciml.ai</a> in the <code>small_grants.md</code> file with a declaration for the grant in the section of the project of interest. For example:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>In Progress</strong>: Claimed by XXXXXX for the time period of &#40;today&#41; - &#40;one month later&#41;.</p> </blockquote> <p>In your pull request, please share:</p> <ul> <li><p>Full legal name</p> <li><p>CV</p> <li><p>Short bio / background about your experience in the topic</p> <li><p>Description of which project you&#39;re interested in</p> </ul> <p>If some anonymity is requested, you may instead send this information to sciml@julialang.org.</p> <p>The potential reviewers will discuss the current-ness of the small grant project, the availability of reviewers, and the willingness to review. The small grant project is accepted when a majority of the steering council approves of the project and the PR is merged. At that point the work will commence under the supervision of the reviewer. When the reviewer accepts and merges the appropriate PRs, the grant will be determined as completed and the payout will commence. The grants are project based and payout will only occur upon acceptance by the reviewer.</p> <p>Note that information about ongoing projects will be tracked as public information below in order to give clear information to other contributors about what projects are taken. Completed projects will be added to a projects archive.</p> <h2 id=going_over_the_one-month_time_budget ><a href="#going_over_the_one-month_time_budget" class=header-anchor >Going Over the One-Month Time Budget</a></h2> <p>Each project is given a one month exclusive period for the purpose of decreasing competition. The difference between the small grants program and a standard bounty program is that we wish to discourage &quot;sniping&quot; bounties from others, i.e. someone working for a few weeks on a project before suddenly someone else appears with a complete solution and takes the payout. While this is not impossible to prevent, as an open source community there may be others who happen to be working the same project independently, to reduce the occurrences of this phonomena we have a policy that payouts will only occur for declared projects. This policy can be overriden on special circumstances by a majority vote of the steering council.</p> <p>In order to discourage &quot;spotting&quot;, i.e. claiming projects to sit on them indefinitely and thus blocking other contributors, only one month exclusive periods are granted. If the project seems to be going beyond this one month timeframe, the contributor should ask for an extension by making a new pull request to bump the time window, which would then need to pass by a majority vote of the steering council. If a new claim PR is opened after the time window has passed without the contributor formally bumping the time window, then the new claim PR will be reviewed under the assumption that the project is not currently active.</p> <p>Note that unsuccessful small grants projects, i.e. claims of potential projects where the contributor disappears and does not end up with a PR, will be used in the criteria of whether further requests are accepted.</p> <h2 id=getting_paid_out ><a href="#getting_paid_out" class=header-anchor >Getting Paid Out</a></h2> <p>After a succesful project, a pull request to <a href="https://github.com/SciML/sciml.ai">https://github.com/SciML/sciml.ai</a> must be made that updates the Small Grants project page declaring the project as completed by moving it to the completed section. This pull request then must be merged by the designated reviewer. Once this is merged, the project is declared to be successfully completed unless comments by the reviewer in the pull request suggest otherwise. Upon completion, open an expense report at <a href="https://opencollective.com/sciml/expenses/new">https://opencollective.com/sciml/expenses/new</a> and follow the instructions to submit an expense. In the expense report,</p> <p>We need a PDF invoice on file. Please submit an invoice using an invoice template &#40;for example: https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/invoices&#41; that contains the following information:</p> <ul> <li><p>Current Date</p> <li><p>Unique Invoice Number</p> <li><p>Name and Contact Information</p> <li><p>Bill To Information &#40;NumFOCUS&#41;</p> <li><p>Project Name and Grant Information &#40;if relevant&#41;</p> <li><p>Period of Work Performed</p> <li><p>Itemized List of Work Performed</p> <li><p>Short description</p> <li><p>Hourly rate</p> <li><p>Total for Invoice</p> <li><p>Payment Terms &#40;e.g., Net 30&#41;</p> </ul> <p>Lastly, in order to process payment, we the following should be added as a comment to the report filing:</p> <ul> <li><p>SWIFT/BIC#</p> <li><p>IFSC</p> <li><p>Account Number</p> </ul> <p>A steering council member will review that the expense matches the approved grant and, if so, approve the expense. This finalizes the process and the payment will be sent.</p> <h2 id=donating_to_the_program ><a href="#donating_to_the_program" class=header-anchor >Donating to the Program</a></h2> <p>If you wish to donate to the SciML Small Grants Program, <a href="https://numfocus.org/donate-to-sciml">please donate via NumFOCUS</a>. SciML via NumFOCUS is a 501&#40;c&#41;&#40;3&#41; public charity in the United States. Your donation is tax-deductible to the extent provided by US law. General donated funds are used for the developer programs such as the small grants program and the SciML Fellowship.</p> <p>Donations can be earmarked towards specific projects. In order for an earmarked project to become a part of the SciML Small Grants program it must be approved by the SciML Steering Council. The reason why all chosen projects must be vetted by the Steering Council is that we want to be fair to the potential contributors, and this means we must ensure that the suggested projects will have a prompt review process and proper maintanance beyond the timeframe of the project. For this reason, we suggest discussing with maintainers in the official Slack/Zulip before making an earmarked donation.</p> <h2 id=adding_projects_to_the_list ><a href="#adding_projects_to_the_list" class=header-anchor >Adding Projects to the List</a></h2> <p>If you wish to add a project to the small grants list, open a pull request in the <a href="https://github.com/SciML/sciml.ai">https://github.com/SciML/sciml.ai</a> in the <code>small_grants.md</code> file with a full description of the project and the suspected monetary payout. New projects require approval by a steering committee member. The justification for the funding is required. If it is a personal donation, it is recommended that personal donation is made prior to the PR, though for known members of the community this requirement can be waived. Some of the projects can be covered through prior grant funds and other donations made to the SciML project, though it should not be assumed that this will be the case for any project without review by a steering committee member.</p> <h2 id=commitments_from_reviewers ><a href="#commitments_from_reviewers" class=header-anchor >Commitments from Reviewers</a></h2> <p>Reviewers are committed to giving timely feedback and reviews. It is expected that you keep in constant touch with the reviewer during the duration of the project, discussing on one of the community chat channels at least a few times a week until project completion. Discussions should take place in the SciML Slack or Zulip channels &#40;#diffeq-bridged or #sciml-bridged&#41; to allow for other contributors to give feedback. Reviews of PRs should be expected within a few days to ensure the contributor can complete the project in the allotted time frame.</p> <p>However, it is also expected that the contributor can work fairly independently with guidance from the reviewer. Contributors are expected to be comfortable enough in the area of expertise to work through the errors and test failures on their own. The SciML Small Grants Program is not a training program like Google Summer of Code or the SciML Fellowship, and thus the reviewer is not expected to mentor or teach the contributor how to solve the problem. The reviewer is in no obligation to help the contributor work through tests, bug fixing, etc. as these projects were chosen due to the fact that the maintainers have not been able to find the time to cover these areas. The obligation of the reviewer is to give a timely feedback on what the requirements for merging would be &#40;i.e. what tests are required to be added, whether certain code meets style demands, etc.&#41; so that the contributor can achieve a mergable PR within the time frame, but there is no expectation that the reviewer will &quot;go the extra mile&quot; to teach the contributor how the package or mathematics works.</p> <h1 id=list_of_current_projects ><a href="#list_of_current_projects" class=header-anchor >List of Current Projects</a></h1> <h2 id=update_neuralpde_to_be_more_maintainable_300 ><a href="#update_neuralpde_to_be_more_maintainable_300" class=header-anchor >Update NeuralPDE to be more maintainable &#40;&#36;300&#41;</a></h2> <p><strong>In Progress</strong>: Claimed by Arushi Gupta for the time period of January 25th - February 25th.</p> <p>NeuralPDE is a package for training Physics Informed Neural Networks based on Lux.jl.

The benchmark results are generated using the benchmark server. Half of the benchmarks are setup using hand-discretized finite difference stencils for the PDE, the other half use ApproxFun.jl in order to do a pseudospectral discretization.

As such, keeping these benchmarks up-to-date can be a time-consuming task. In many cases, we can end up in a situation where there are many package bumps that need to happen. Sometimes no code needs to be updated, in other cases the benchmark code does need to be updated. The only way to tell is to start the update process, bump the project and manifest tomls, and start digging into the results.</p> <p>These bumps are done in subsets.

However, many of the methods can be collapsed by class into a single solver set using a tableau implementation that loops over coefficients. Because of the nuances in performance and implementation, we have avoided doing this refactoring until a few more pieces were set in stone.</p> <p>Note that this should be done based on classes of solvers, as documented in the code as files in the <code>perform_step&#33;</code> implementations &#40;though the explicit Runge-Kutta methods are split across a few files and should all be a single tableau&#41;. Solver set should be discussed before starting the project.</p> <p>It is recommended that implicit methods such as Rosenbrock and SDIRK integrators are done first, as the extra intricacies of their algorithm make this refactor simpler because the nuances of the implementation are less likely to noticably impact performance.</p> <p><strong>Information to Get Started</strong>: The OrdinaryDiffEq.jl solvers are all found in <a href="https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl">the Github repository</a> and the format of the package is docmented in the <a href="https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDevDocs/stable/">developer documentation</a>. The key to doing this right is to note that it is just a refactor, so all of the methods are there in the package already. However, note that some methods can be a bit nuanced, for example, BS5 and DP8 use fairly non-standard error estimators for an explicit Runge-Kutta method, while Verner methods have a twist with laziness. Because of this, the key is to be careful to add points to dispatch to alternative based on the nuances of the given algorithms.</p> <p><strong>Related Issues</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl/issues/233">https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl/issues/233</a></p> <p><strong>Success Criteria</strong>: The independent solver packages are registered and released, and a breaking update to OrdinaryDiffEq.jl is released which reduces the loading time by not including all solvers by default.

Extended due to scope and cost extension. **</p> <p>It&#39;s no surprise to anyone to hear that DifferentialEquations.jl, in particular the OrdinaryDiffEq.jl solver package, is very large and takes a long time to precompile. However, this is because there are a lot of solvers in the package. The goal would be to refactor this package so that sets of solvers are instead held in subpackages that are only loaded on-demand. Since many of the solvers are only used in more niche applications, this allows for them to be easily maintained in the same repo while not imposing a loading cost on the more standard appliations.</p> <p><strong>Information to Get Started</strong>: The OrdinaryDiffEq.jl solvers are all found in <a href="https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl">the Github repository</a> and the format of the package is docmented in the <a href="https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDevDocs/stable/">developer documentation</a></p> <p><strong>Related Issues</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl/issues/2177">https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl/issues/2177</a></p> <p><strong>Success Criteria</strong>: The independent solver packages are registered and released, and a breaking update to OrdinaryDiffEq.jl is released which reduces the loading time by not including all solvers by default.

However, many of the operators incorrectly make the assumption that <code>u &#61; v</code>, i.e. <code>A&#40;u,p,t&#41;*u</code> is the operation. While this is the only case required for some ODE integrators, this oversimplification limits the full usage of the library.
